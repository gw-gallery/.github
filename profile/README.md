# GW Gallery

I ([Tom Callister](https://github.com/tcallister)) give a lot of talks about gravitational-wave astronomy.
In the course of giving a lot of talks, I end up designing a lot of figures, animations, and demonstrations that (I hope) effectively illustrate gravitational-wave data, principles of data analysis, and/or the relevant astrophysical principles.
My goal is to share some of these here (both figures/animations themselves and the code with which they're produced) so that others can make use of them as well.
